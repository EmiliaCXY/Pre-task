# Question 1
We say that Pattern is a most frequent k-mer in Text if it maximizes Count(Text, Pattern) among all k-mers. For example, "ACTAT" is a most frequent 5-mer in "ACAACTATGCATCACTATCGGGAACTATCCT", and "ATA" is a most frequent 3-mer of "CGATATATCCATAG".

**Find the most frequent k-mers in a string.**

**Given:** A DNA string Text and an integer k.

**Return:** All most frequent k-mers in Text (in any order).
### Sample Input
```
ACGTTGCATGTCGCATGATGCATGAGAGCT
4
```
### Sample Output
```
CATG GCAT
```
# Question 2
We say that a k-mer is shared by two genomes if either the k-mer or its reverse complement appears in each genome. In the figure below are four pairs of 3-mers that are shared by "AAACTCATC" and "TTTCAAATC".

A shared k-mer can be represented by an ordered pair (x, y), where x is the starting position of the k-mer in the first genome and y is the starting position of the k-mer in the second genome. For the genomes "AAACTCATC" and "TTTCAAATC", these shared k-mers are (0,4), (0,0), (4,2), and (6,6).

**Given two strings, find all their shared k-mers.**

**Given:** An integer k and two strings.

**Return:** All k-mers shared by these strings, in the form of ordered pairs (x, y) corresponding to starting positions of these k-mers in the respective strings.
### Sample Input
```
3
AAACTCATC
TTTCAAATC
```
### Sample Output
```
(0, 4)
(0, 0)
(4, 2)
(6, 6)
```
